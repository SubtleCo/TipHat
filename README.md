# TipHat

## Description

TipHat is a web application aimed at encouraging users to rethink how they value music in the streaming age.

The app allows users to generate an artist-based listening report based on their [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) account. This listening history is then crossed reference with the user's music streaming service to generate an estimated amount of revenue each artist has received from the streaming service per the user's listening habits. Each report also includes a comparison to how much the artist potentially could hava made, has the user purchased the music (as a CD, LP, or bandcamp purchase). The user is then presented with the difference between the streaming revenue and the potential sale revenue, encouraging the user to perhaps make a purchase directly from the artist, or simply make a donation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
